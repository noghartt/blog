      "description": "The traditional approach to replicated systems involves co-locating the write-ahead log (WAL) on nodes maintaining state, often using consensus protocols like Paxos or Raft. Google's Colossus stores logs and state for internal systems and cloud services like Bigtable and Spanner. AWS developed a transactional journal primitive for multi-zone replicated services like DynamoDB and Amazon S3. Other companies like Meta and Fauna are exploring disaggregated log setups for improved management and scalability. The concept of a hypothetical S2, a serverless API for logs, could revolutionize distributed systems by simplifying complex processes and enabling innovative design solutions.",

The paper provides a formal definition of the \"happened before\" relation and the Clock condition for logical clocks. It also discusses the limitations of logical clocks and presents a system of clocks using physical clocks that can satisfy the strong clock condition. The document concludes with an example of how Lamport clocks can be used to solve the mutual exclusion problem and a TLA+ specification based on the paper's concepts.",

From one\nside I find it genuinely encouraging, because if one gets so much information\njust by scratching the topic, imagine what’s hidden beneath the surface! One\nuniversity professor once said “what could be interesting in databases?”, and\nit turns out freaking a lot! On the other side it certainly poses problems for\npotential readers. To overcome them I would suggest an interesting approach:\nprint this blog post out, or open it on your tablet/e-reader, where you can\nmake notes with a pencil or markers. Now while reading it try to spot ideas\nparticularly exciting for you and mark them. Along the way there would be\ndefinitely some obscure parts or questions, write them on the sides as well.\nYou can experiment with the diagrams, changing or extending them, or just\ndrawing funny faces. But do not read everything at once, have no fear of\nputting it aside for a while, and read in chunks that are convenient for you.\nSome parts could be skipped as the text is build out of relatively independent\ntopics. The table of contents can help and guide you. Having said that we’re\nready to embark on the journey.",

      "description": "March 2024(This is a talk I gave to 14 and 15 year olds about what to do now\nif they might want to start a startup later. Lots of schools think\nthey should tell students something about startups. This is what I\nthink they should tell them. Notice it makes no mention of business\nplans.)Most of you probably think that when you're released into the\nso-called real world you'll eventually have to get some kind of\njob. That's not true, and today I'm going to talk about a trick you\ncan use to avoid ever having to get a job.The trick is to start your own company. So it's not a trick for\navoiding work, because if you start your own company you'll\nwork harder than you would if you had an ordinary job. But you will\navoid many of the annoying things that come with a job, including\na boss telling you what to do.It's more exciting to work on your own project than someone else's.\nAnd you can also get a lot richer. In fact, this is the standard\nway to get \nreally rich. If you look at the lists of the richest\npeople that occasionally get published in the press, nearly all of\nthem did it by starting their own companies.Starting your own company can mean anything from starting a barber\nshop to starting Google. I'm here to talk about one extreme end of\nthat continuum. I'm going to tell you how to start Google.The companies at the Google end of the continuum are called startups\nwhen they're young. The reason I know about them is that my wife\nJessica and I started something called Y Combinator that is basically\na startup factory. Since 2005, Y Combinator has funded over 4000\nstartups. So we know exactly what you need to start a startup,\nbecause we've helped people do it for the last 19 years.You might have thought I was joking when I said I was going to tell\nyou how to start Google. You might be thinking \"How could we\nstart Google?\" But that's effectively what the people who did start\nGoogle were thinking before they started it. If you'd told Larry\nPage and Sergey Brin, the founders o...",

If design is responsive motion in a space of all possible designs, then some designs are acceptable and some are not. Designing, then, is like walking an island. As long as you don’t get your feet wet, the design is okay. (This is a visual way of describing design as an optimization problem, but I’ll stick with the metaphor because it turns out to be surprisingly apt.)",

Semiconductors are materials that can have their conductivity varied by many orders of magnitude, which makes it possible to selectively block and allow the flow of electrons. This property makes it possible to manufacture all sorts of electronic devices, not least of which is the digital computer.",

      "description": "June 2006(This essay is derived from talks at Usenix 2006 and\nRailsconf 2006.)A couple years ago my friend Trevor and I went to look at the Apple\ngarage.  As we stood there, he said that as a kid growing up in\nSaskatchewan he'd been amazed at the dedication Jobs and Wozniak\nmust have had to work in a garage.\"Those guys must have been\nfreezing!\"That's one of California's hidden advantages: the mild climate means\nthere's lots of marginal space.  In cold places that margin gets\ntrimmed off.  There's a sharper line between outside and inside,\nand only projects that are officially sanctioned — by organizations,\nor parents, or wives, or at least by oneself — get proper indoor\nspace.  That raises the activation energy for new ideas.  You can't\njust tinker. You have to justify.Some of Silicon Valley's most famous companies began in garages:\nHewlett-Packard in 1938, Apple in 1976, Google in 1998.  In Apple's\ncase the garage story is a bit of an urban legend.

Some of them are better than others, depending on the situation.\n\nBased on CMU 15-462 course materials by Keenan Crane.\n\n\n  Representations\n    \n      Rotation Matrices\n      Euler Angles\n      Quaternions\n      Axis/Angle\n    \n  \n  The Exponential and Logarithmic Maps\n    \n      Axis/Angle in 2D\n      Axis/Angle in 3D\n      Averaging Rotations\n      Quaternions (Again)\n    \n  \n  Further Reading\n\n\nRepresentations\n\nRotation Matrices\n\nLinear-algebra-wise, the most straightforward representation is an orthonormal 3x3 matrix (with positive determinant). The three columns of a rotation matrix specify where the x, y, and z axes end up after the rotation.\n\nRotation matrices are particularly useful for transforming points: just multiply! Even better, rotation matrices can be composed with any other linear transformations via matrix multiplication. That’s why we use rotation matrices when actually drawing things on screen: only one matrix multiplication is required to transform a point from world-space to the screen. However, rotation matrices are not so useful for actually working with rotations: because they don’t form a vector space, adding together two rotation matrices will not give you a rotation matrix back. For example, animating an object by linearly interpolating between two rotation matrices adds scaling:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRandomize\n\n\n\n$$ R_0 = \\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\\\0&1&0\\\\0&0&1\\end{bmatrix} $$\n$$ R(0.00) = \\begin{bmatrix}\\phantom{-}1.00&\\phantom{-}0.00&\\phantom{-}0.00\\\\\\phantom{-}0.00&\\phantom{-}1.00&\\phantom{-}0.00\\\\\\phantom{-}0.00&\\phantom{-}0.00&\\phantom{-}1.00\\end{bmatrix} $$\n$$ R_1 = \\begin{bmatrix}-1&0&0\\\\0&1&0\\\\0&0&-1\\end{bmatrix} $$\n\n\nEuler Angles\n\nAnother common representation is Euler angles, which specify three separate rotations about the x, y, and z axes (also known as pitch, yaw, and roll).

      "description": "Talk at Bellcore, 7 March 1986The title of my talk is \"You and Your Research.\" It is not about managing research, it is about how you individually do your research. I could give a talk on the other subject — but it's not, it's about you. I'm not talking about ordinary run-of-the-mill research; I'm talking about great research. And for the sake of describing great research I'll occasionally say Nobel-Prize type of work. It doesn't have to gain the Nobel Prize, but I mean those kinds of things which we perceive are significant things. Relativity, if you want, Shannon's information theory, any number of outstanding theories — that's the kind of thing I'm talking about.Now, how did I come to do this study? At Los Alamos I was brought in to run the computing machines which other people had got going, so those scientists and physicists could get back to business. I saw I was a stooge. I saw that although physically I was the same, they were different. And to put the thing bluntly, I was envious. I wanted to know why they were so different from me. I saw Feynman up close. I saw Fermi and Teller. I saw Oppenheimer. I saw Hans Bethe: he was my boss. I saw quite a few very capable people. I became very interested in the difference between those who do and those who might have done.When I came to Bell Labs, I came into a very productive department. Bode was the department head at the time; Shannon was there, and there were other people. I continued examining the questions, \"Why?\" and \"What is the difference?\" I continued subsequently by reading biographies, autobiographies, asking people questions such as: \"How did you come to do this?\" I tried to find out what are the differences. And that's what this talk is about.Now, why is this talk important? I think it is important because, as far as I know, each of you has one life to live. Even if you believe in reincarnation it doesn't do you any good from one life to the next! Why shouldn't you do significant things in this one l...",

T1 ends up working with stale data if T2 does not commit.\nT2 starts executing and sets x to a new value, T1 starts executing and reads x, the value of x is the value just set by T2, T2 rolls back, the value of x is not persisted to the database but T1 will move forward with the stale value of x that was written before T2 rolled back.",

      "description": "December 2005The most impressive people I know are all terrible procrastinators.\nSo could it be that procrastination isn't always bad?Most people who write about procrastination write about how to cure\nit.  But this is, strictly speaking, impossible.  There are an\ninfinite number of things you could be doing.  No matter what you\nwork on, you're not working on everything else.  So the question\nis not how to avoid procrastination, but how to procrastinate well.There are three variants of procrastination, depending on what you\ndo instead of working on something: you could work on (a) nothing,\n(b) something less important, or (c) something more important.  That\nlast type, I'd argue, is good procrastination.That's the \"absent-minded professor,\" who forgets to shave, or eat,\nor even perhaps look where he's going while he's thinking about\nsome interesting question.   His mind is absent from the everyday\nworld because it's hard at work in another.That's the sense in which the most impressive people I know are all\nprocrastinators.  They're type-C procrastinators:  they put off\nworking on small stuff to work on big stuff.What's \"small stuff?\"  Roughly, work that has zero chance of being\nmentioned in your obituary.  It's hard to say at the time what will\nturn out to be your best work (will it be your magnum opus on\nSumerian temple architecture, or the detective thriller you wrote\nunder a pseudonym?), but there's a whole class of tasks you can\nsafely rule out: shaving, doing your laundry, cleaning the house,\nwriting thank-you notes—anything that might be called an errand.Good procrastination is avoiding errands to do real work.Good in a sense, at least.  The people who want you to do the errands\nwon't think it's good.  But you probably have to annoy them if you\nwant to get anything done.  The mildest seeming people, if they\nwant to do real work, all have a certain degree of ruthlessness\nwhen it comes to avoiding errands.Some errands, like replying to letters, go away if you\n...",

      "description": "July 2024Successful people tend to be persistent. New ideas often don't work\nat first, but they're not deterred. They keep trying and eventually\nfind something that does.Mere obstinacy, on the other hand, is a recipe for failure. Obstinate\npeople are so annoying. They won't listen. They beat their heads\nagainst a wall and get nowhere.But is there any real difference between these two cases? Are\npersistent and obstinate people actually behaving differently? Or\nare they doing the same thing, and we just label them later as\npersistent or obstinate depending on whether they turned out to be\nright or not?If that's the only difference then there's nothing to be learned\nfrom the distinction. Telling someone to be persistent rather than\nobstinate would just be telling them to be right rather than wrong,\nand they already know that. Whereas if persistence and obstinacy\nare actually different kinds of behavior, it would be worthwhile\nto tease them apart.\n[1]I've talked to a lot of determined people, and it seems to me that\nthey're different kinds of behavior. I've often walked away from a\nconversation thinking either \"Wow, that guy is determined\" or \"Damn,\nthat guy is stubborn,\" and I don't think I'm just talking about\nwhether they seemed right or not. That's part of it, but not all\nof it.There's something annoying about the obstinate that's not simply\ndue to being mistaken. They won't listen. And that's not true of\nall determined people. I can't think of anyone more determined than\nthe Collison brothers, and when you point out a problem to them,\nthey not only listen, but listen with an almost predatory intensity.\nIs there a hole in the bottom of their boat? Probably not, but if\nthere is, they want to know about it.It's the same with most successful people. They're never more\nengaged than when you disagree with them. Whereas the obstinate\ndon't want to hear you. When you point out problems, their eyes\nglaze over, and their replies sound like ideologues talking about\nmatters...",

Stretching that a bit, we might\nanticipate that a software artifact designed and initially produced by\ntwo people might somehow reflect, not merely the structure of the\norganization, but the internal biases and philosophies each brings to\nthe table. One of us (Seltzer) has spent her career between the worlds\nof filesystems and database management systems. If questioned, she'll\nargue the two are fundamentally the same thing, and furthermore,\noperating systems and database management systems are essentially both\nresource managers and providers of convenient abstractions. The\ndifferences are \"merely\" implementation details. The other (Bostic)\nbelieves in the tool-based approach to software engineering and in the\nconstruction of components based on simpler building blocks, because\nsuch systems are invariably superior to monolithic architectures in\nthe important \"-bilities\": understandability, extensibility,\nmaintainability, testability, and flexibility.",

Thus the work of systems is usually done by\nteams and so it is in my case too. Hence I am accepting this award on behalf\nof the many whom I have worked with as much as for myself. It is not practical\nto name them all, so I will not.

At the time, I had experience with Rust and decided to use it to follow the book. Albeit, being a noob, I managed to implement a fully functional bytecode interpreter that supported every feature of the Lox language as described. However, my implementation suffered memory leaks due to reference counting. Back then, I didn't fully grasp Rust to design and implement a proper garbage collector (GC)! Now that I have more confidence in the language, I decided to revisit the project and improve its memory management scheme.",

But there was some good news: at the Second Clinic, the number was just 4%. Expectant mothers noticed this — some would get down on their knees and beg to be admitted to the Second Clinic. Others, hearing new patients were being admitted to the First Clinic that day, decided they’d rather give birth in the streets.",

      "description": "September 2024At a YC event last week Brian Chesky gave a talk that everyone who\nwas there will remember. Most founders I talked to afterward said\nit was the best they'd ever heard. Ron Conway, for the first time\nin his life, forgot to take notes. I'm not going to try to reproduce\nit here. Instead I want to talk about a question it raised.The theme of Brian's talk was that the conventional wisdom about\nhow to run larger companies is mistaken. As Airbnb grew, well-meaning\npeople advised him that he had to run the company in a certain way\nfor it to scale. Their advice could be optimistically summarized\nas \"hire good people and give them room to do their jobs.\" He\nfollowed this advice and the results were disastrous. So he had to\nfigure out a better way on his own, which he did partly by studying\nhow Steve Jobs ran Apple. So far it seems to be working. Airbnb's\nfree cash flow margin is now among the best in Silicon Valley.The audience at this event included a lot of the most successful\nfounders we've funded, and one after another said that the same\nthing had happened to them. They'd been given the same advice about\nhow to run their companies as they grew, but instead of helping\ntheir companies, it had damaged them.Why was everyone telling these founders the wrong thing? That was\nthe big mystery to me. And after mulling it over for a bit I figured\nout the answer: what they were being told was how to run a company\nyou hadn't founded — how to run a company if you're merely a\nprofessional manager. But this m.o. is so much less effective that\nto founders it feels broken. There are things founders can do that\nmanagers can't, and not doing them feels wrong to founders, because\nit is.In effect there are two different ways to run a company: founder\nmode and manager mode. Till now most people even in Silicon Valley\nhave implicitly assumed that scaling a startup meant switching to\nmanager mode. But we can infer the existence of another mode from\nthe dismay of founders who've t...",

      "description": "December 2019\nThe most damaging thing you learned in school wasn't something you\nlearned in any specific class. It was learning to get good grades.When I was in college, a particularly earnest philosophy grad student\nonce told me that he never cared what grade he got in a class, only\nwhat he learned in it. This stuck in my mind because it was the\nonly time I ever heard anyone say such a thing.For me, as for most students, the measurement of what I was learning\ncompletely dominated actual learning in college.  I was fairly\nearnest; I was genuinely interested in most of the classes I took,\nand I worked hard. And yet I worked by far the hardest when I was\nstudying for a test.In theory, tests are merely what their name implies: tests of what\nyou've learned in the class. In theory you shouldn't have to prepare\nfor a test in a class any more than you have to prepare for a blood\ntest. In theory you learn from taking the class, from going to the\nlectures and doing the reading and/or assignments, and the test\nthat comes afterward merely measures how well you learned.In practice, as almost everyone reading this will know, things are\nso different that hearing this explanation of how classes and tests\nare meant to work is like hearing the etymology of a word whose\nmeaning has changed completely. In practice, the phrase \"studying\nfor a test\" was almost redundant, because that was when one really\nstudied.  The difference between diligent and slack students was\nthat the former studied hard for tests and the latter didn't.  No\none was pulling all-nighters two weeks into the semester.Even though I was a diligent student, almost all the work I did in\nschool was aimed at getting a good grade on something.To many people, it would seem strange that the preceding sentence\nhas a \"though\" in it. Aren't I merely stating a tautology? Isn't\nthat what a diligent student is, a straight-A student? That's how\ndeeply the conflation of learning with grades has infused our\nculture.Is it so bad if...",

Explore Here: https://bit.ly/micron-graphic-memory\nCurious about AI memory and HBM3E?  Take a look:  https://bit.ly/micron-hbm3e\n\nGraphics Cards can run some of the most incredible video games, but how many calculations do they perform every single second?  Well, some of the most advanced graphics perform 36 Trillion calculations or more every single second.  But how can a single device manage these tens of trillions of calculations?  In this video, we explore the architecture inside the 3090 graphics card and the GA102 GPU chip architecture.  \n\nNote: We chose to feature the 30 series of GPUs because, to create accurate 3D models, we had to tear down a 3090 GPU rather destructively. We typically select a slightly older model because we're able to find broken components on eBay. If you're wondering, the 4090 can perform 82.58 trillion calculations a second, and then we're sure the 5090 will be even more.\n\nTable of Contents:\n00:00 - How many calculations do Graphics Cards Perform?\n02:15 - The Difference between GPUs and CPUs?\n04:56 - GPU GA102 Architecture\n06:59 - GPU GA102 Manufacturing\n08:48 - CUDA Core Design\n11:09 - Graphics Cards Components\n12:04 - Graphics Memory GDDR6X GDDR7\n15:11 - All about Micron\n16:51 - Single Instruction Multiple Data Architecture\n17:49 - Why GPUs run Video Game Graphics, Object Transformations\n20:53 - Thread Architecture\n23:31 - Help Branch Education Out!\n24:29 - Bitcoin Mining\n26:50 - Tensor Cores\n27:58 - Outro\n\nWe're working on more ambitious subjects like computer architecture and graphics cards.

      "description": "October 2024I'm usually reluctant to make predictions about technology, but I\nfeel fairly confident about this one: in a couple decades there\nwon't be many people who can write.One of the strangest things you learn if you're a writer is how\nmany people have trouble writing. Doctors know how many people have\na mole they're worried about; people who are good at setting up\ncomputers know how many people aren't; writers know how many people\nneed help writing.The reason so many people have trouble writing is that it's\nfundamentally difficult. To write well you have to think clearly,\nand thinking clearly is hard.And yet writing pervades many jobs, and the more prestigious the\njob, the more writing it tends to require.These two powerful opposing forces, the pervasive expectation of\nwriting and the irreducible difficulty of doing it, create enormous\npressure. This is why eminent professors often turn out to have\nresorted to plagiarism. The most striking thing to me about these\ncases is the pettiness of the thefts. The stuff they steal is usually\nthe most mundane boilerplate — the sort of thing that anyone who\nwas even halfway decent at writing could turn out with no effort\nat all. Which means they're not even halfway decent at writing.Till recently there was no convenient escape valve for the pressure\ncreated by these opposing forces. You could pay someone to write\nfor you, like JFK, or plagiarize, like MLK, but if you couldn't buy\nor steal words, you had to write them yourself. And as a result\nnearly everyone who was expected to write had to learn how.Not anymore. AI has blown this world open. Almost all pressure to\nwrite has dissipated. You can have AI do it for you, both in school\nand at work.The result will be a world divided into writes and write-nots.\nThere will still be some people who can write. Some of us like it.\nBut the middle ground between those who are good at writing and\nthose who can't write at all will disappear. Instead of good writers,\nok writers, and ...",

      "description": "There comes a moment in life, often in\n      the quietest of hours, when one realizes\n      that the world will continue on its\n      wayward course, indifferent to our              desires or frustrations. And it is then,\n      perhaps, that a subtle truth begins to\n      emerge: the only thing we truly possess,\n      the only thing we might, with enough\n      care, exert some mastery over, is our\n      mind. It is not a realization of\n      resignation, but rather of liberation.\n      For if the mind can be ordered, if it           can be made still in the midst of this\n      restless life, then we have already\n      discovered the key to a deeper kind of\n      freedom.",

It has prompted many a quote tweet, and founders, such as Bryan Cantrill of Oxide Computer, have started contributing their own thoughts to what founder mode means to them.\nHaving held positions of influence at a few companies, but never having been a founder myself, my initial read raised a few thoughts about my own experience of trying to “scale myself” in a growing organization.",
