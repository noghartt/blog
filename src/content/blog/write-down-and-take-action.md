This morning, I thought about what I would do beyond my usual routine, and I remembered that I had been doing a lot of research on building a new project.

So, I decided to simply jot it down on a piece of paper:

**Write about the proposal for a new platform**

If it weren't for this, I would probably just forget about it and leave it for another day.

Write down the things you need to do and do them; promise this to yourself.

Don't overload the list, write down only what is necessary/important

Write down.

Take action.
