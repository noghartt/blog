Okay, I'll be starting a new kind of blog post here. The idea is bringing some
insights and things I watched, read or did in the week.

## What I'm doing

- Studied a bit about how exactly DNA/RNA works. Understand a bit about RNA polymerase
  and how exactly RNA transcript into mRNA.
- Read a bit about [Game Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory).
  Learned more about [Zero-sum games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game), [Nash equilibrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium), [Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax)
  and the [Prisoner's Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma).
- I'm still working in my [Viewstamped Replication Protocol](https://github.com/noghartt/viewstamped-replication-rs) implementation.
  Finishing the implementation of my [Deterministic Simulation Testing](https://notes.eatonphil.com/2024-08-20-deterministic-simulation-testing.html) runner,
  which is missing some specific parts for test: adding the randomness workflow + seed to
  insert random actions during the tests, etc.
- Finished reading Akira, volume 1.
- Started reading Nicomachean Ethics, by Aristotle.
- Based on the release of [Hashcards](https://borretti.me/article/hashcards-plain-text-spaced-repetition), I started
  doing some new experiments with [Spaced Repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition). I'll
  be coming back here in the next weeks with some report on that.
- Started a new run in Factorio + playing Terraria with a friend of mine.

## What I read

This will be mostly based on the things I read based on my [bookmarks](/bookmarks).
Just compiling some of the most interesting/cool things, the other ones, feel free to
check by yourself in the other page, there's more than I could reference here.

- [What is Algebraic about Algebraic Effects?](https://interjectedfuture.com/what-is-algebraic-about-algebraic-effects/)
- [CMU #08 - B+Trees: The Best Data Structure in the World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7ii_Lvm9rM)
- MOV instructions are Turing Complete: [Weird CPU architectures, the MOV only CPU](https://justanotherelectronicsblog.com/?p=771).
- [Examples are the best documentation](https://rakhim.exotext.com/examples-are-the-best-documentation)

- [RNA is the cell's emergency alert system](https://www.quantamagazine.org/rna-is-the-cells-emergency-alert-system-20250714)

The most cool ones I read this week, I think are the above. Maybe I'm forgetting something I read
which is on my bookmarks, but if that's the case, it's wasn't too much relevant to link here anyway.
